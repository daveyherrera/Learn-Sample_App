# How to write a README file

In order to submit content to the Anthology Community, the contribution (project) that you want to make must have a README file. This file will give an overview of your project and will allow other contributors or users to follow the base steps that you will describe for making your project work.

Here are the primary guidelines that your README file should follow:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are the guidelines that will be evaluated once you want to submit your contribution to the organization.

## **Project title:**

The name of the project should contain two parts. The first part is the target product (Learn, Student, Reach, etc.) and the second part is the name of the project itself (A clear and concise title that accurately describes and represents your project).

> [!WARNING]
> The name should not contain any spaces or special characters. The separator between the product and the project name should always be a hyphen ( - ) and, if the project name has multiple words, they should be separated by underscores ( \_ )

An example of the name for an API application: "Learn-My_awesome_API_application"

## **Description:**

This will have a short description about the target of the project, why is needed, the functionality and the scope of it.

## **Prerequisites:**

This section needs to have the information about system requirements needed before launching the project (specific packages, minimum required OSs, language versions, etc).

## **Installation:**

These will contain the detailed instructions the user will need to follow in order to make your project work on their environment. Here you can specify all the configurations and installation commands needed to make your project work.

> [!TIP]
> You could create a file under the docs folder where you explain in detail the installation process of your project and then, you can reference the file here.

## **Usage (Launching the project):**

This will have the necessary commands along with the instructions of how to use the project, you could include code samples or screenshots if needed.

## **FAQ:**

Here you can put some usual questions - answers that a user could have about your project, this section should be updated with the latest information based on own testing or issues submitted.

## **Troubleshooting:**

Here you can specify some common errors that you could get when installing or using your project and how to solve them.

> [!TIP] > **Keep your user in mind:** Your readme will be the first thing that a user will see, so try to keep it as simple and easy to understand as possible.

## **License:**

YOu can make reference to the license the contribution will have by either adding the verbose here (if it's not long) or creating a LICENSE.md file in the root of your repository containing the license information.

# How to publish your contribution to the Anthology-Community

Once you have your project ready and you have followed the guidelines for the README file, you can submit your contribution to the Anthology-Community organization. Here are the steps that you will need to follow:

1. Create an issue in the Contributions repo ([Here](https://github.com/anthology-inc/community-contribution/issues/new/choose)) using the template **"Publish Code"**
2. Follow the template that is provided in the issue and fill it with the information of your project.
3. Once the issue is approved, the Approvers will create a new repository under the Anthology Inc organization and upload your code there. They will also give you write access to that repository so you can keep updating the code if needed.
