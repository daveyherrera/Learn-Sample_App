# How to contribute using a video

## When recording your video

Please keep in mind the following tips:

1. Make sure that there is a space between the recording start and your voice (sometimes the video, at least on macs, cut off the beginning). It is better to start the recording and wait a couple of seconds to start talking.
2. Speak loud. Speak clear.
3. If possible, create a script to follow. This helps you to follow your ideas and organize and avoid forgetting important pieces of information you may need to communicate
4. Always show a demo, describing first the problem, and providing a clear visual of the citation and how to solve it or how your idea or solution helps to solve this problem step by step.
5. Usually, it is better to just turn off all notifications, close all other windows and record your whole screen.
6. Review your video before asking for an upload, I know it is kind of weird to hear your own voice, but this is necessary in order to verify the audio and the video.

## How to record your video.

On a mac it is quite easy, just hit command + shit + 5 and it will show a small window with a menu. It will allow you to either take a screenshot or record.

You can also use, which is a better option at least from my perspective, Microsoft teams. Set up a meeting and record it with transcription. This will allow us to add subtitles to the video.

Just like that, whenever you need this to be published on Anthology Developers YouTube channel, it will also be easier just to send us the link of that recording.

## How to submit your video for publication

To submit the video, please create a new issue on the Contributions repository ([Here](https://github.com/anthology-inc/community-contribution/issues/new/choose)) using the template **"Publish video"** filling all the required fields.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To submit your video, please upload it to a cloud space (OneDrive, SharePoint, Google Drive, etc.) and provide us the URL of the location for later download. Upload the video at full quality to avoid compression or quality issues when uploading it to YouTube.
